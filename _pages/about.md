I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Electronic, Electrical and Systems Engineering at the University of Birmingham and Deputy Head of the Resilient Systems and Climate Action Research Group. After seven years working in the utility industry, I left a great company in 2018 to pursue a PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of Birmingham. My research focused on resilience assessment of electrical power systems with wildfires and low-carbon technologies. After completing my PhD in 2022, I began my current role where my research interests include electricity distribution system planning, forecasting, power system resilience, and climate adaptation of interdependent critical infrastructure.
